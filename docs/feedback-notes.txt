Sam Guyer:
Overall, I like your project proposal. You have a lot of interesting points in 
the “Problem” and “Context” section, but in some ways they are both descriptions
of the context. I’d like to see more details about the technical nature of the
problem. You are trying to use SMS to support services/technologies that would
normally use cellular data. Those two methods of communication have very
different properties, so it will be challenging to make services tolerant to 
those differences.

Great job on the risks. The next step is to think about how to mitigate those 
risks -- what are some options you could explore if these mechanisms don’t 
work the way you want them to?

response: 

We updated our project proposal on github with the relevant information 
regarding the techical nature of the problem.
